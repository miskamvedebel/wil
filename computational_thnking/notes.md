# What's recipe

1. Sequence of simple steps
2. Flow of control process that specifies when the concrete step is executed
3. A means of determing when to stop

Step 1 + 2 + 3 = Algorithm
Example used - square root, getting random guess, checking how far we are, then taking average of x and x/g (g is the input)

# machines
stored program machines - able to execute any programs
fixed program machines - able to execute only one program - like calculator for instance.

Turing: with 6 operations we can program almost everything.

# Languages

- primitive construct
    English: words
    programming language: numbers, string, simple operations
- syntax
    English:
     `cat dog boy` - not syntactically valid
     `cat hugs boy` - syntactically valid
    programming language 
     `"hi"5` - not valid
     `3.2 * 5` - valid
- static semantics - valid strings have a meaning
    English:
     `I are hungry`
- semantics - meaning that associated with a syntactically correct strings of symbols with no semantic errors

Where things could go wrong:
    syntactic errors, static semantic errors, no semantics errors but different meaning

# Python programs 

Data objects - type
    - are scalars (`int`, `floats`, `bool` (True, False), `NoneType` (None))
    - non-scalars

`print` has NoneType
