## What is optimization model?

An objective function that is to be maximized or minimized
    for instance: minimize spent traveling from NY to Boston
A set of constraints (possiblu empty) that must be honored, e.g:
    cannot spend more than $100
    must be in Boston before 5PM

Many problems of real importance can be formulated as an optimization problem
Reducing a seemingly new problem to an instance of a well-known problem allows one to use pre-existing methods for solving the problem
Solving optimization problems is computationally challenging
Greedy algorithms is often apractical approach to finding a pretty good `approximate` soltuion to an optimization problem

## Knapsack problem and Bin-packing Problems

Two variant of knapsack problem:
    0/1 - knapsack problem
    Continuous or fractional knapsack problem

0/1 Knapsack problem formalized:
- Item `(value, weight)`
- Knapsack could accomadate total weight of `w`
- vector `L` of length `n` that represents the set of available items
- vector `V` of length `n` => to indicate whether the item is taken or not. `V[i] = 1` => then taken. `V[i] = 0` => not taken

Find the `V` than maimizes `sum(V[i] * I[i].value)` and it's a subject of constraint that `sum(V[i] * I[i].weight) <= w`

Brute Force"
1. enumerate all the possible combinations
2. remove the combinations whose total units exceeds the allowed weight
3. from remaining combinations choose any one whose value is the largest

Brute Force is usually not practical
- How big is the power set?
- V is the length of n => 2 ** n => exponential algorithm

0/1 knapsack problem is inherently exponential.
 - greedy solutions are good for some of the problems, but they migth be suboptimal;
 - brute force


 # Dynamic Programming

 Richard Bellman

 for instance fibonnaci sequence it takes lot of time, because we call it many times.
 so, we repeat the same operations many times, in `fib(6)` - for instance, `fib(3)` is repeated three times => then comes the main idea => to trade time for space, we create a table to record what's done before, we then check if we have the value in the table before the execution

 - optimal substructure;
 - overlapping subproblems
