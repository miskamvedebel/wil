## The problem it solves

Increasing sample (read waiting more time) might be expensive, at the same time, results that are not far outside the range - migth be useful. So, CUPED is decreasing standard error for the same sample size and metric.
Pre-experiment data in this case is used to get knowdledge about the variance.
