# Framework

1. **Goal**: define the goal you want to achieve, usually it's something that is tied to the success of the business.
    - Defining metric of interest
      > A/B testing might not give you all the answers, so it's important to have other ways of getting the data. Example: `abandonment` metric from Google - user did the query, but nothing else. They got there and left. No way to know what happened. Which metric to choose here, probably users found what they were looking for on the search result page, or they didn't think that any of the results were good. Many questions - and it's dificult to measure in terms of A/B test. So instead - Lab to reproduce, or surveys to to try to get some emotional or qualitative feedback.
      - metric sensitivity: how much of a change in experiment it takes to cause a change in the metric. It is important to select metrics that are capable of detecting and reflecting the change you are making.
      - avoid bias, don't select metrics that can't fail
      - tracking multiple metrics, choose secondary metrics that can give the full picture
3. Identify an area of focus for achieving that goal:
    - by addressing a problem that you want to solve for your users;
    - finding opportunity area to offer your users something that didn't exist before
4. Create hypothesis statement - structured way of describing the belief about your users and product that you want to test.
5. Create test by designing the actual experience that represents the idea.
6. Getting reaction and analysing it, make decision on what to do next.
