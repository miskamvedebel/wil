# Framework

1. **Goal**: define the goal you want to achieve, usually it's something that is tied to the success of the business.
    - Defining metric of interest
      > A/B testing might not give you all the answers, so it's important to have other ways of getting the data. Example: `abandonment` metric from Google - user did the query, but nothing else. They got there and left. No way to know what happened. >
3. Identify an area of focus for achieving that goal:
    - by addressing a problem that you want to solve for your users;
    - finding opportunity area to offer your users something that didn't exist before
4. Create hypothesis statement - structured way of describing the belief about your users and product that you want to test.
5. Create test by designing the actual experience that represents the idea.
6. Getting reaction and analysing it, make decision on what to do next.
